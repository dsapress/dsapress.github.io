title: Paper Formatting Instructions
---

<p>All papers are provided in <em>markdown</em> format.</p>

<p>We will convert from markdown to other formats provided on the site including Jupyter notebook, PDF and HTML.</p>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>We accept code interspersed within the text, initially we are restricting to Python3.7 and R as we work out our publishing pipelines.</p>

<p>Code included in the main text is integrated in the following way. Each code block is surrounded by four 'reverse quotes' as follows:</p>

<pre>
```{python}
import numpy as np
a = np.randn(10)
```
</pre>

<p>Code that is included in the main text should be relevant to the main text. In other words, it should not disrupt the readers flow. Code that is peripheral to the flow of the paper should be in a separate library file that is imported at the beginning of the file. This library should have a comment above indicating the import.</p>
<pre>
```{python}
# helper code
import dsa_helper
```
</pre>

<h2>Maths</h2>

<p>Maths is included in standard latex style, using dollar signs to denote both inline math and display mode math. So inline math is denoted as below.</p>

<pre>
$y=x^2$
</pre>

<p>would render as $y=x^2$. To get display math mode (an equation outside the line of the text) you use two dollar signs as follows:</p>
<pre>
$$
y=x^2,
$$
</pre>
Here we have added a comma to punctuate the equation. Equations are always punctuated as if they are a word in line with the text. So in the text the equation,
$$
y=x^2,
$$
appears with commas either side. If you're interested in how to punctuate math you may want to read <a href="https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~amenta/w10/writingman.pdf">this</a>.

<h2>Citations</h2>

We handle citations in the journal using <code>pandoc-citeproc</code>, an extension to markdown that allows citations. The final version of your document will be processed by pandoc. But the main thing you need to know is that citations are included by starting with an 'at-sign', so a citation has the form <code>@Mwebaze-causal2010</code> might refer to a paper stored in a bib file as follows.

<pre>

  abstract =     {Food shortages are increasing in many areas of the world.
                  In this paper, we consider the problem of
                  understanding the causal relationships between
                  socioeconomic factors in a developing-world
                  household and their risk of experiencing famine. We
                  analyse the ex tent to which it is possible to
                  predict famine in a household based on these
                  factors, looking at a data collected from 5404
                  households in Uganda. To do this we use a set of
                  causal structure learning algorithms, employed as a
                  committee that votes on the causal relationships
                  between the variables. We contrast prediction
                  accuracy of famine based on feature sets suggested
                  by our prior knowledge and by the models we learn.}
