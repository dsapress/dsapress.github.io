<h1>Proceedings of Data Science Africa Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>The Proceedings of Data Science Africa are very much a
community effort. 

<h2>How do I publish a paper with you?</h2>

<p>Paper publications are handled through pull requests on Github. There are three main stages.
  <ul>
    <li>Fork the repo containing the current submission volume.</li>
    <li>Create a new file under the ```_posts``` directory named ```YYYY-MM-DD-paper-title.md```where `YYYY` is the current year (Gregorian calendar), `MM` is the current month in digits, `DD` is the day of the current month, starting with `0` if it is one of the first 10 days. `paper-title` is the title of your paper in lower case, with `-` replacing punctuation and spaces, e.g. "Malaria Distribution in Uganda" becomes "malaria-distribution-in-uganda".</li>
    <li>Write your paper using *markdown*, see paper formatting instructions <a href="./format.html">here</a>.</li>
    <li>When your paper is ready for submission, submit a *pull request*. You will be assigned a mentor who will work through your paper with you using Github's code review tools. When the paper is ready, the pull request will be merged.</li>
  </ul>
